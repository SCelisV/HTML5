        <h3>Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.</h3>

        <h3>To display a less than sign (<) we must write: &lt; or &#60;</h3>

                A character entity looks like this: <br>

                &entity_name;<br>
                OR <br>
                
                &#entity_number; <br>
        </p>

        <h2>Non-breaking Space</h2>

        <h3>A common character entity used in HTML is the non-breaking space: "&" + "nbsp" ;</h3>

        <h3>Another common use of the non-breaking space is to prevent that browsers truncate spaces in HTML pages.

            If you write 10 spaces in your text, the browser will remove 9 of them. <br> 
            
            To add real spaces to your text, you can use the &nbsp; character entity.
