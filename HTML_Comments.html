        <p>comments for notifications and reminders: <!-- comments --></p>
            <!-- Write your comments here -->
            <!-- This is a comment -->

        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

        <!-- Remember to add more information here -->


        <p>Comments are also great for debugging HTML, because you can comment out HTML lines of code, one at a time, to search for errors:

<!-- Do not display this at the moment
<img border="0" src="pic_mountain.jpg" alt="Mountain">
-->

    </body>
